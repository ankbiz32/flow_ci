                        We at Flow, have focused on addressing both the sides of the coin. While we cater to the needs of the students to help them grow up to be reasonable and compassionate individuals, we have also given an equal amount of thought into supporting the ‘Teacher’, who is the ‘WOLF’ that leads the pack.
