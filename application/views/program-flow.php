                        Our student modules have been structured on the basis of the framework of Lev Vygotsky’s learning theory on ZPD (Zone of Proximal Development), wherein all the modules have been created keeping in mind the most immediate psychological development of learners that includes a wide range of their emotional, cognitive, and volitional psychological processes. Our trainers’ modules have been designed with a learner centric approach through Scaffolding which provides the students with a significant ‘More Knowledgeable Other’ (MKO) in order to guide them to reach their full potential to understand all the nine modules

                        Whilst the skills acquired through academic study are in constant use, it is possible for the concepts learned to sometimes exist in the mind alone if not applied and experienced, where they can eventually cease to exist. 
                        <br>
                        Free to Learn Our Way is different, as it relates directly to experiences that students will have in their everyday lives. It is possible to teach all about the concepts that we have created in our program to students, but that would be to miss the point. We believe that the teaching must have experience as its primary aim: we should be teaching the students not just ‘to know’ but also how to be and to do.
                        <br>
                        In order for this to work, we have to get the students to experience it. Our approach helps us to do it, which is:
