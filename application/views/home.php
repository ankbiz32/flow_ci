                FLOW invites all the principals and coordinators of all the renowned schools of Jagdalpur to experience the program and get a glimpse of the journey that we are to embark on. FLOW began with a question, ‘What was something that was not a part of my education, but I wish it was!’, and from then on, we are constantly striving to serve the future generations by adding every possible element of life that is of utmost importance.
                <br>
                FLOW does not only cater to one side of the coin, which is why we have also addressed the needs of the facilitators through the WOLF initiative program (Workshop on Learning and Facilitation) which is a mirror image of ‘FLOW’ as students are a mirror reflection of the teachers that tutor them for life. <br>
                The WOLF initiative program was created with an intent to provide the teachers an underpinning insight about purposeful teaching methods, soft skills development, lesson planning, phonetics, and work-life balance etc.  We assure you these sessions cover just the tip of the iceberg.
